Frequency helper
=================

A simple tool to help with cryptology frequency search.

Usage:
------

You give the program a string that will follow a regular expresion to find all similar words.

Use "_" to match any word, "#" to match same character inside the word and any other character to match.

Example:
-----

We have the word 'ashhe'
I guess the two 'h' represent the same character, I know it has length 5 and that there is the same characte in the 3rd and 4th positions.
The string to match such words would be '__##_'.

Disclaimer:
-----

This is a really old program when I was first startin to code. It is even coded in spanish (Although I have changed the outputs) so don't expect good code from it.
